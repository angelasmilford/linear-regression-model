# Overview

Iâ€™m focused on expanding my understanding of programming languages and building a strong foundation in data analysis. One of my current goals is to learn how to manipulate data and create clear, effective visualizations that communicate insights.

To explore the R language, I wrote a simple program that builds a linear regression model using a built-in dataset. The program prints a summary of the model and generates a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between two variables.

My main purpose for writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with R's syntax, especially for statistical modeling and plotting. I also wanted to begin exploring different types of graphs like pie charts, histograms, and box plots.

# Development Environment

I used the R language in Visual Studio Code with the R extension. I also set up a GitHub repository to store and version-control my work. I installed the R runtime to allow my IDE to run scripts and view plots directly.

For this project, I used the R language and its datasets library.

# Future Work

- Add examples of other plot types (histograms, pie charts, box plots)
- Create multiple regression models with more than one predictor
- Use external datasets instead of just built-in ones
